                    When I was a sophomore in high school I was never into girls but one day I saw this new freshman girl named Katrina and
                    she was so cute and sexy. And although I never told anybody from the first moment I saw her I wanted to drink that new
                    girl Katrina urine in front of people in public. Well one day in front of everyone at school outside in the courtyard my
                    friend Lari and Kim told me that girl Katrina wanted me to lay down on the ground on my back. I looked over at that girl
                    Katrina and she was smiling at me so I was so turned on I started getting on the ground. And while I did I saw that new girl
                    Katrina taking off her pants and her panties and throwing them on the ground. While I was laying on my back I couldn't believe
                    that new girl Katrina was naked from the waist down in front of 50 or 60 people at school. Then that new girl Katrina slowly
                    walked over to me stepped over me and then squatted down right over my face and told me to open my mouth. When I did that
                     girl Katrina pushed slowly pushed her pee hole push the people smoking deep as far down deep down into my throat as she
                     could until I could feel her pee hole tickling my throat. Then in front of all these people out loud that girl Katrina said
                     "Sandi hold your throat wide open for me". Then as I looked up straight into that girl Katrina's eyes and held my throat
                     wide open for her that girl Katrina started teens straight young back of my wide open throat in front of all these people.
                     Within a second I could taste that girl Katrina warm salty yellow urine down in the back of my throat. God I couldn't believe
                     how good and delicious her urine tasted while I was drinking her urine in front of all these people while they were watching me
                     drinking that girl Katina's urine in front of them. That girl Katrina was smiling down at me with the biggest smile like she was
                     completely turned on seeing me drinking her warm salty yellow urine while people were watching me. From that very moment everyday
                     at school that girl Katrina would make me drink her urine in front of everyone at school.
